# cs3892015team1

The whole setup of this branch is different from the master branch.
So, if you want to test it, don't merge with the master. I won't work.

Create a new folder and clone just this branch.
To do that, you can use this command:

$ git clone -b design --single-branch  https://github.com/paceuniversity/cs3892015team1.git
